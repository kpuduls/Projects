# MPC Spacecraft controller

* Implemented using formulation for a standard MILP solver
* Matlab files obtainable (request directly through email)
* Using Hills equations for near circular orbits
* Optimization for fuel efficiency
* Curently the use is limited to a single spacecraft
* Two spacecraft formation formulation possible (requires redefining state space model)

## Stable version - MILPv2
### MILPfunc - for use with CW projects trajectory propagation and visualization tools
